## App Description: 
- A perceptron is a form of simple neural network, consisting of a single neuron that takes a feature vector with n coordinates, assigns each coordinate with a corresponding weight, and outputs the feature vectorâ€™s classification based on a threshold function. The perceptron algorithm was conceptualized by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957, and it was one of the first neural networks to be implemented.
